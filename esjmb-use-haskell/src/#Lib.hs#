-- | These are language extensions. Haskell has a great many language
-- extensions but in practice you do not need to knwo much about them. If you
-- use a library that needs them, then the library documentation will tell you which
-- extensions you neeed to include. If you try to write code that needs particular extensions,
-- then the haskell compiler is smart enough typically to be able to suggest which extensions
-- you should switch on by including an entry here.

-- | Haskell code is structured as sets of functions that sit within Modules. The basic rule is that a module with a
-- particular name (for example Lib) sits within a .hs file of the same name (eg. Lib.hs). The module statement is of
-- the form `module MODULE_NAME (EXPORTED_FUNCTIONS) where`. Everything following this is part of the module. There are
-- no brackets or any other syntax to worry about.
module Lib
    ( startApp
    ) where

-- | Imports work like most other languages and are essentially library includes. The functions of the lirbary become
-- immediately accessible in the code of the module. There are various ways in which imports can be modified. For
-- example, one may `import qualified X as Y` which imports a library in such a way that the functions of the library
-- must be prefixed with `Y.`. One can always prefix a libraries functions with the import string, when calling them.
-- You will occasionally have reason to import libraries that have common function names by coincidence. You can use
-- qualified imports of full prefixes to disambiguate. The compiler will tell you where the problem is if this occurs.
